## Lab Questions

###  Why can we not just use structural Verilog to implement latches?

We can not use structral verlog to allow us to implement latches and memory because once you assign something it then becomes that thing and does not allow it to change.

### What is the meaning of always @(*) in a sensitivity block?

Always @(*) allows us to exicute a block of code with any combination of inputs or single variables has a change in value .

### What importance is memory to digital circuits?

Memory is important to digital circuits because it allows us to create the basic systems of storge, it is what all computers run off of and enable them to do tasks.
